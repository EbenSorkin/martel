Martel Devanagari
=================

Martel Devanagari is a libre font development project. Begun in 2008 in the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication at the University of Reading, the first weights of the font family (Martel UltraLight, Light, Regular and DemiBold) were released in 2014. Heavier weights are still in development. The Devanagari glyphs to-date have all been designed by Dan Reynolds, whereas the Latin scriptâ€™s glyphs are based on the Merriweather fonts.

The Martel Devanagari typeface is designed for typesetting immersive-style documents. It may be be used to set long passages of text in languages that are written in the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit, etc. Martel Devanagari is a readable typeface whose glyph proportions are inspired by traditional writing and calligraphic styles. Its high-contrast strokes have a diagonal axis, in keeping with the pen-angle most often used for the Devanagari writing system.

Two folders are hosted here: <em>Martel Font Files</em> and <em>Martel Source Files</em>. The font files folder contains both PostScript-flavored OpenType fonts (.otf) and TrueType-flavored fonts (.ttf). The .ttf-files have been auto-hinted with ttfautohint version 1.1. All of the font files were generated with the Glyphs font editing application. The source files folder contains a native Glyphs file as well as UFOs exported from Glyphs. These are offered as-is.
