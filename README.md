Martel Devanagari
=================

Martel Devanagari is a libre font development project. Begun in 2008, the first weight of the font family (Martel DemiBold) was released in 2014. Additional weights are in development. See the “Devanagari_still_in_development” folder for more information. All Latin script glyphs are based on the Merriweather fonts.

The Martel Devanagari typeface is designed for typesetting immersive-style documents. It may be be used to set long passages of text in languages that are written in the Devanagari script, including Hindi, Marathi, Nepali, Sanskrit, etc. Martel Devanagari is a readable typeface whose glyph proportions are inspired by traditional writing and calligraphic styles. Its high-contrast strokes have a diagonal axis, in keeping with the pen-angle most often used for the Devanagari writing system.
